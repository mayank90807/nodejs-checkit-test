### Exercise

Leta owns a gaming shop. She has the details about the customers, products and customer purchases in her database. She hires you to get her insights about customer purchases that would help her run various promotions for the customers.

The following is the content of her database.

```json
{
  "customers": [
    { "id": "c1", "firstname": "Isa", "lastname": "Smith" },
    { "id": "c2", "firstname": "Lennon", "lastname": "Willis" },
    { "id": "c3", "firstname": "Carter", "lastname": "Cooke" },
    { "id": "c4", "firstname": "Rohan", "lastname": "Harris" }
  ],
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "p1",
      "name": "PlayStation 5"
    },
    {
      "id": "p2",
      "name": "Xbox Series X"
    },
    {
      "id": "p3",
      "name": "Nintendo Switch"
    },
    {
      "id": "p4",
      "name": "Valve Steam Deck"
    }
  ],
  "purchases": [
    {
      "customerId": "c1",
      "purchases": [
        {
          "productId": "p2",
          "purchasedAt": "2022-01-02T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        {
          "productId": "p2",
          "purchasedAt": "2022-02-20T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        {
          "productId": "p1",
          "purchasedAt": "2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        {
          "productId": "p1",
          "purchasedAt": "2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "customerId": "c3",
      "purchases": [
        {
          "productId": "p4",
          "purchasedAt": "2022-01-02T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        {
          "productId": "p4",
          "purchasedAt": "2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        {
          "productId": "p3",
          "purchasedAt": "2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        {
          "productId": "p1",
          "purchasedAt": "2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "customerId": "c2",
      "purchases": [
        {
          "productId": "p1",
          "purchasedAt": "2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Your task is split into 3 steps according to the difficulty. Each step will require you to extract some insights from the above dataset and print it on the console.

    "firstname": "Lennon",
    "lastname": "Willis"
  },
  {
    "id": "c3",
    "firstname": "Carter",
    "lastname": "Cooke"
  }
]
```

### Step 2

## Tips

- Don't worry about writing an optimised solution the first time. Aim for a working solution first.
- We would like to see your knowledge in built-in JavaScript/Node.js features. So please do not use any 3rd party packages in your solution.
- You are free to 'google' if you need to refresh your memory on the syntax of any JavaScript function you may use.
- You can make any existing javascript feature provided in the NodeJS version you use (We advise to use the latest NodeJS LTS version)
- Sort order of the output is irrelevant. So don't worry if you get the same output but with a slightly different order.
